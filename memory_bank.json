An agent can be a robot, a software program, or even a human. The key characteristic of an agent is its autonomy – it operates without direct human intervention to achieve its goals. Agents can be simple, like a thermostat that turns on the heat when it gets cold, or complex, like a self-driving car.\n\n2.  **Worked Example:**\n\nConsider a vacuum cleaner robot. Its sensors might include cameras and bump sensors to perceive its surroundings. Its actuators are its wheels and vacuum motor. The robot's goal is to clean the floor. Based on what it \"sees\" (obstacles, dirt), it decides where to move and when to turn on the vacuum.\n\n3.  **Summary:**\n\nAn agent perceives its environment and acts autonomously to achieve goals.\nIt uses sensors to see and actuators to act.\n\n4.  **Sources:**\n\n*   **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th Edition) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig:** (I am sorry, I cannot provide the sources as I do not have access to the internet.)\n*   **Wikipedia - Intelligent Agent:** (I am sorry, I cannot provide the sources as I do not have access to the internet.)\n*   **Towards Data Science - Introduction to Intelligent Agents:** (I am sorry, I cannot provide the sources as I do not have access to the internet.)\n",

It's characterized by complex procedures, paperwork, and regulations that can delay or hinder action or decision-making. Red tape often involves unnecessary or overly complicated processes that make it difficult to get things done efficiently. It can occur in government, large corporations, or any organization with a rigid hierarchical structure.\n\n2.  **Worked Example:**\n\nImagine a small business owner trying to obtain a permit to open a new store. They might face a mountain of paperwork, multiple inspections, and long waiting times due to various regulations and bureaucratic procedures. This excessive bureaucracy, hindering the timely opening of their business, is an example of red tape.\n\n3.  **Summary:**\n\nRed tape is excessive bureaucracy that delays action.\nIt involves complex rules and procedures that hinder efficiency.\n\n4.  **Sources:**\n\n*   **Investopedia - Red Tape:** [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redtape.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redtape.asp)\n*   **Wikipedia - Red Tape:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape)\n*   **Business Dictionary - Red Tape:** [https://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/red-tape.html](https://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/red-tape.html)\n",
